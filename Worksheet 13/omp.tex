    \answerbox{1cm}
    OMP is trying to solve an equation of the form $A\vec{x} = \vec{b}$.
    This make look familiar, as we have discussed other ways of solving this equation,
    like Gaussian elimination, inverse matrices, or least squares.
    In this question, we will explore when and why we would want to use OMP instead of
    these other techniques.

        This first half of the problem focuses on the motivation of and assumptions made in the OMP algorithm.

    \item In the equation $A\vec{x} = \vec{b}$, what are $A$, $\vec{x}$, and $\vec{b}$?
    Specifically, what are their dimensions, and what do they mean in the context of
    a real-world problem like GPS trilateration? 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What does $A$ represent? What are its dimensions? What do $A_i$ and $A_{i,j}$ represent?
        \answerbox{0.5cm}
        \\ \\
        \sol{
            $A$ is an $n\times m$ matrix, where $m$ is the number of devices and $n$ is the signal
            broadcasted by each device. Therefore, $A_i$ is the signal from the $i$th device, and
            $A_{i,j}$ is the $j$th element of the signal.
        }

        \item What does $\vec{x}$ represent? What are its dimensions? What does $x_i$ represent?
        \answerbox{0.5cm}
        \\ \\
        \sol{
            $\vec{x}$ is an $m\times 1$ matrix, so we just say it is a vector of size $m$.
            $x_i$ represents the scaling factor (and the strength) of the signal sent out by the $i$th device.
        }

        \item What does $\vec{b}$ represent? What are its dimensions?
        \answerbox{0.5cm}
        \\ \\
        \sol{
            $\vec{b}$ is an $n\times 1$ matrix, so we just say it is a vector of size $n$.
            $\vec{b}$ represents the signal the signal received by the receiver.
        }
    \end{itemize}

    \item To solve $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$, what assumptions do we need to make in order to use each of the following techniques?
    \\ \\
    \note{
        Try to explain how each of these assumptions would be violated in the context of the GPS problem.
    }
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Gaussian elimination
        \answerbox{1cm}
        \\ \\
        \sol{There must be no noise in our received signal $\vec{b}$.}
        \item Inverse matrices
        \answerbox{1cm}
        \\ \\
        \sol{
            $A$ must be square and its columns must be linearly independent.
            Note that GE can be used even when $A$ is not square.
        }
        \item Least squares
        \answerbox{1cm}
        \\ \\
        \sol{
            $A^TA$ must be invertible, which in turn means $A$ must have a non-trivial nullspace
            (see \href{http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee16a/fa19/lecture/Note23.pdf}{Note 23} for more details.)
            This also means $A$ must have linearly independent columns.
        }
    \end{itemize}

    \item What specific assumptions does the OMP algorithm make? \textit{
        Hint: there's three main ones.
    }
    \answerbox{2cm}
    \\ \\
    \sol{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item There are many devices that could be broadcasting signals
            \item The signals sent by each device are nearly orthogonal to each other
            \item Only a few devices are actually sending out signals, i.e.
                  there are few $i$ for which $x_i$ would be nonzero.
        \end{itemize}
    }
    \item What do these assumptions imply about
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the dimensions of $A$, the matrix whose columns are all our possible beacons?
        \answerbox{0.5cm}
        \item the relationship between $a_i$ and $a_j$, two of our possible beacon signals?
        \answerbox{0.5cm}
        \item the scaling factors in $\vec{x}$?
        \answerbox{0.5cm}
    \end{itemize}
    \sol{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $A$ should be short and wide, as we have many possible signals
            \item $<\vec{a_i}, \vec{a_j}> \approx 0$, as our signals are nearly orthogonal
            \item most $x_i$ are 0, as $\vec{x}$ is sparse
        \end{itemize}
        Note that $A$ here is the $A$ in our original equation $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$,
        not the same as the $A$ constructed by the OMP algorithm. The $A$ constructed by OMP
        simply omits all beacons that we believe to not be broadcasting, i.e. $\vec{a_i}$ for which $x_i$ is 0.
    }

    We now know what assumptions are necessary to apply OMP. Now let's talk about the algorithm!
    OMP as a whole revolves around a simple strategy. We keep track of how much of the received signal is
    still unaccounted for, find the strongest device within that signal, subtract out that component from
    the unaccounted for signal, and repeat until we can't find more beacon signals.
    \\ \\
    \note{
        We now focus on the steps of the algorithm itself.
